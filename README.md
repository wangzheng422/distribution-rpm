# package rpm for dockre distribution

distribution is a member of cnc, it had rpm long before, but now we can't find the rpm for newest version. So we build a new one for it.

Note: this is a demo, and only build for openshift 4 / rhcos / coreos

# build step

```bash
dnf install -y rpmdevtools rpmlint



```

# how to use

```bash


```
